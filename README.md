This is a short example that demonstrates how to quickly build an application using Sightly and [Apache Sling](http://sling.apache.org).

# Prerequisites
Assuming you already have downloaded and started Apache Sling (if you didn't [here's](https://sling.apache.org/downloads.cgi) a link) you have to install the [Path Based RTP](https://github.com/apache/sling/tree/trunk/samples/path-based-rtp) from the Sling Samples source folder.

# Install this application
Assuming that you're running Sling using defaults all you have to do is 
`mvn clean install sling:install` and the application is installed

# Running this application
Point your browser to [http://localhost:8080/content/sightly-blog/posts.list.html]
(http://localhost:8080/content/sightly-blog/posts.list.html) and enjoy
